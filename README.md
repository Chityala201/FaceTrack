## 3) Explain the diagram in the above diagram in simple words using the bullet list.
### a)	Data Collection and Preparation
Input Data: Gather datasets with human faces and videos containing human faces.
Data Annotation: Label images with bounding boxes around faces using tools like LabelImg.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize, resize, and augment images to enhance the training set.
### b)	 Model Development
Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained model such as MobileNet
Model Training: Fine-tune the model using TensorFlow on the annotated dataset.
Validation: Evaluate model performance with a validation set to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting.

### c)	Optimization
Model Optimization: Reduce model size and improve speed through techniques like quantization and pruning.
Testing on Devices: Ensure the model works efficiently on devices like Raspberry Pi.

### d)	API Development and Integration
API Development: Create an API using Flask or FastAPI to handle model inference requests.
Integration with Applications: Connect the API to frontend applications for real-time detection.
### e)	Deployment
Local Deployment: Deploy on local servers or edge devices.
Cloud Deployment (Optional): Optionally deploy on cloud platforms for scalability.
